# Booking Confirmation API Definition

## Introduction

When a customer returns to Expedia to review their reservation, or when they receive confirmations or updates for their reservation via e-mail, Expedia shall include the hotel’s confirmation number. The presence of the hotel confirmation number guarantees that the booking was properly received and confirmed by the hotel system and thereby raises customer confidence at check-in. The confirmation number also makes consolidation between Expedia and the hotel easier for accounting and tracking purposes.
The Booking Confirmation (BC) API is the mechanism EQC partners are required to implement to provide Expedia with the hotel’s confirmation number for all bookings retrieved via the BR interface. Unconfirmed bookings will revert to fax or email once the booking expiration time is reached.

### Supported Features for Booking Confirmaion
EQC partner must use the booking confirmation API to confirm bookings retrieved electronically (reservations, modifications, and cancellations).

Confirmation numbers have to be received before bookings expire. Else, bookings will fall back to fax or email. Expedia’s booking expiration strategy is based on booking window:
- For same-day arrival (based on midnight in hotel’s local timezone): bookings will expire 30 minutes after their creation by customer.
- For next-day arrival (any bookings created between midnight and 23:59:59 the day before arrival, based on hotel’s local timezone): bookings will expire 60 minutes after their creation by customer.
- For any longer booking window, bookings will expire 24 hours after their creation by customer.

Booking confirmation numbers can be updated for already confirmed bookings up to 8 days after guest’s departure date.

## Booking Confirmation Request
The booking confirmation request message (BC RQ) allows EQC partners to send hotel confirmation numbers for new, modified and/or cancelled bookings on Expedia Inc. points of sale.

## Booking Confirmation Response

The booking confirmation response message (BC RS) contains a success or error message for the confirmation of a new, modified or cancelled booking. Note that a success message may include a warning that should require action by the EQC partner. There is one response per booking update, so if a booking confirmation request sends a confirmation update for 5 bookings, then there will be 1 response message sent back with additional nodes for each warning or error.

### Booking Confirmation Validation Process
To update a booking with a confirmation number successfully, the following validations are applied through EQC for each confirmation sent in the BC RQ message:
* The username and password are valid
* The bookingID belongs to the specified hotel
* The check-out date has not passed
* The confirmation number is more recent than any existing confirmation number for the booking. For instance, if the EQC partner sends two BC requests for the same booking, EQC will look at the timestamp included in the message and ensure the most recent is applied.
* The booking type specified in the confirmation matches the new, modified, or cancelled state of the booking. Note that if a customer modifies a booking before Expedia sends the booking details to the EQC partner in a booking retrieval message, the confirmation booking type should still be set to “Book” because the first delivery of a booking to the EQC partner is always considered a new booking. 
An additional validation makes sure that no more than 10 confirmation numbers are sent in the BC RQ message.

## Error Handling
Recommendations for system and technical problems will be the same across all EQC interfaces. For more information about recommendations, please review the [corresponding EQC BR section](reference-br.html#errorhanlding).
