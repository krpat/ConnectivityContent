# Expedia Group Cookie Policy

'People Shaped Travel' is our motto so we work hard to listen to our partners and in return to deliver a smart and engaging website that reflects their needs. One of the ways in which we do this, is through the use of cookies.

## 2. Why does Expedia Group use cookies?

Cookies allow us to improve the website's content, functionality and speed, while their tracking ability also helps us to understand your likes and dislikes, which means we can respond quickly and adapt the site accordingly.
At Expedia Group, we use cookies because it's important to us that the time you spend on our website, is as useful and intuitive as possible.
In fact without cookie placement, a website cannot remember your preferences or registration details for your next visit.
The important thing to remember about all of this is that whilst some cookies are used to track your use of our website, they cannot be used to identify you personally or tell us who you are.
Here's a snapshot of all of the cookies we use on join.expediapartnercentral.com, expediaconnectivity.com, and discover.expediapartnercentral.com  along with a snippet of information about what they do.

## 3. What cookies does Expedia Group use?

### First and third-party cookies

There are many different types of cookies and at join.expediapartnercentral.com, expediaconnectivity.com, and discover.expediapartnercentral.com, we use them all. Those set by us are called 'first-party cookies'. Those set by our partners and suppliers are called 'third-party cookies'. Third-party cookies enable visitors to our website to see and interact with content such as videos and advertising provided to us by other companies. The same cookies can also help us with website analytics. More on that a little later.

### Session and persistent cookies

As with most websites, we also use 'session cookies', which exist only for the length of time that you visit our site and are deleted once you close your browser, along with 'permanent cookies' also known as 'persistent cookies' which remain stored on your browser ready for use the next time you visit our website.

### Essential cookies

These are required to help you access secure areas (such as your partner account pages). Essential cookies are critical because you can’t access these services without them.

### Performance and functionality cookies

These cookies ensure the display of handy features such as maps and videos. We love them because they help to enhance the performance and functionality of our website, and we want the time you spend on our site to be both useful and engaging.

### Analytics and customisation cookies

We use analytics and customisation cookies to gather information on how the website is being used by our visitors and to discover how popular our marketing campaigns are. We also use the data we get to help customise the website for you and make the content you see as relevant as possible.

### Advertising cookies

Advertising cookies are used to ensure that we only show you the adverts and messages we think you will want to see. Cleverly, they also help us to restrict the number of times you see the same advert, ensure the ad is properly displayed.

### Social networking cookies

As the name suggests, Social Networking Cookies allow visitors like you to share our pages and content through third-party social networking websites. Why not put them to the test and share this page when you finish reading it?
